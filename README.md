Three.js Learning Projects

This repository is where I’m documenting my journey of learning front-end development with Three.js — a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
Each folder here represents a small project or exercise I built while exploring new concepts. My goal is to improve step by step and build a stronger foundation in 3D web development.

Day 1 – Spinning Cube

Folder: day-01-spinning-cube

This was my very first attempt at building something with Three.js. It’s a simple scene with a rotating green cube — nothing fancy, but it helped me understand the core pieces of any Three.js project:

Setting up a Scene, Camera, and Renderer

Adding a basic Mesh (the cube)

Using Geometry and Material

Creating an animation loop to make the cube rotate

How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/first_project.git
cd first_project/day-01-spinning-cube


Install dependencies:

npm install


Start a local development server:

npx vite


or

npm run dev


Open your browser and go to the local address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

About This Repository

I’m learning by doing — each new folder here will represent a small project I create while exploring a new concept, idea, or challenge.
Some projects might be very basic, while others will get more complex as I gain confidence. My plan is to slowly build a portfolio of examples that show my progress with Three.js and front-end development.
