# Three.js Learning Projects

This repository is where I’m documenting my journey of learning front-end development with **Three.js** — a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.  
Each folder here represents a small project or exercise I built while exploring new concepts. My goal is to improve step by step and build a stronger foundation in 3D web development.

## Day 1 – Spinning Cube

**Folder:** `day-01-spinning-cube`

This was my very first attempt at building something with Three.js. It’s a simple scene with a rotating green cube — nothing fancy, but it helped me understand the core pieces of any Three.js project:

- Setting up a `Scene`, `Camera`, and `Renderer`
- Adding a basic `Mesh` (the cube)
- Using `Geometry` and `Material`
- Creating an animation loop to make the cube rotate

### How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/first_project.git
   cd first_project/day-01-spinning-cube
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
Start a local development server:

bash
npx vite
or

bash
npm run dev
Open your browser and go to the local address shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

About This Repository
I’m learning by doing — each new folder here will represent a small project I create while exploring a new concept, idea, or challenge.
Some projects might be very basic, while others will get more complex as I gain confidence. My plan is to slowly build a portfolio of examples that show my progress with Three.js and front-end development.

Next Steps
Experiment with lighting and shadows

Add textures and materials

Build interactive 3D scenes

Explore camera controls and user input

This is just the beginning. I’m excited to keep pushing myself and see how much I can grow by building something new every day.
